# Basketball Court

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/basketball-court.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/basketball-court)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/fralonra/basketball-court.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/fralonra/basketball-court)

Generate a basketball court in SVG format. Can be outputed as a string or convert into an SVGElement.
The dimensions data are collected from [Wikipedia][wiki], and stored in [JSON files][datas] in meters. If you find there are some errors, please open an issue or send a PR!

## Install

```bash
npm install basketball-court
```

or

```bash
yarn add basketball-court
```

## Usage

```javascript
const court = require('basketball-court')
// Or include the script in your HTML.
// <script src="/path/to/basketball-court.min.js"></script>

// Convert svg to string, which can be outputed as a file.
console.log(court().toString())
// Or you might want to use it as an SVGELement.
const element = court().toDom()
```

## API

#### court ([options])

- `options` - The options object.
  - `width` - The width of the court in px. Default: 400.
  - `type` - The type of the court. Valid values: `nba`, `fiba`, `ncaa`, `wnba`.  Default: `nba`.
  - `theme` - There are currently four preseted themes: `plain`, `beach`, `steppe`, `volcano`. You can preview each of the theme [here][themes]. Custom themes are also supported, you can check [here][theme config] to learn about how to customize each part of the court. You can extend a theme by `data` property which is described below. Default: `plain`.
  - `ftCircleDashCount` - The number of dashed lines and spaces between them along a free throw circle. Default: 15.
  - `horizontal` - Whether the court should be horizontal. Default: false.
  - `halfCourt` - Whether to generate only a half court. Default: false.
  - `reverse` - Whether to generate a reversed court. Noted that it would look the same if `halfCourt` is false. Default: false.
  - `trapezoid` - Whether the lane area should has a trapezoid shape (or a rectangle otherwise). Default: false.
  - `data` - Additional config which that would override theme config. Check [here][theme config] for more information.

## Theme Config

To specify a preset theme, just do the following:

```js
court({
  theme: 'beach' // This will apply the `beach` theme for you instead of the default `plain`.
})
```

### Customize

The script will generate an SVGElement which contains a `g` element as its sole child. Every part of the court is an element to this `g` element and can be customized seperately. The below image shows each part of the court and they are listed in z-index order.

<img src="/public/paths.svg" alt="paths" title="paths" />

- global: Use on the `g` element. You can define some global property here.
- court: The side line and the base line.
- centerCircle: The center circle.
- restrainCircle: The restraning circle inside the center circle.
- hcline: The half-court line.
- tpline: The three-point line.
- lane: The lane (key or painted area or restricted area or three second area).
- innerLane: The rectangle inside the lane. Will never be rendered if `trapezoid` is `true` in options.
- ftCircleHigh: The free-throw circle (high post side).
- ftCircleLow: The free-throw circle (low post side).
- restricted: Restricted area.
- backboard: The backboard.
- rim: The rim (or hoop or basket).

To hide a path, just set it to `false` and you are done!

```js
court({
  theme: {
    backboard: {
      stroke: red // This will stroke the backboard in red.
    },
    rim: false // This will hide the rim.
  }
})
```

***Note:*** You should be care of the property values for that you might encounter the problem of script injection if they are unsafe string.

You can use `data` option to extend the preset theme.
```js
court({
  theme: 'beach',
  data: {
    rim: false
  }
})
```
