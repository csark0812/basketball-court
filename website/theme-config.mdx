## Theme Config

To specify a preset theme, just do the following:

```js
court({
  theme: 'beach' // This will apply the `beach` theme for you instead of the default `plain`.
})
```

### Customize

The script will generate an SVGElement which contains a `g` element as its sole child. Every part of the court is an element to this `g` element and can be customized seperately. The below image shows each part of the court and they are listed in z-index order.

<img src="/public/paths.svg" alt="paths" title="paths" />

- global: Use on the `g` element. You can define some global property here.
- court: The side line and the base line.
- centerCircle: The center circle.
- restrainCircle: The restraning circle inside the center circle.
- hcline: The half-court line.
- tpline: The three-point line.
- lane: The lane (key or painted area or restricted area or three second area).
- innerLane: The rectangle inside the lane. Will never be rendered if `trapezoid` is `true` in options.
- ftCircleHigh: The free-throw circle (high post side).
- ftCircleLow: The free-throw circle (low post side).
- restricted: Restricted area.
- backboard: The backboard.
- rim: The rim (or hoop or basket).

To hide a path, just set it to `false` and you are done!

```js
court({
  theme: {
    backboard: {
      stroke: red // This will stroke the backboard in red.
    },
    rim: false // This will hide the rim.
  }
})
```

***Note:*** You should be care of the property values for that you might encounter the problem of script injection if they are unsafe string.

You can use `data` option to extend the preset theme.
```js
court({
  theme: 'beach',
  data: {
    rim: false
  }
})
```
